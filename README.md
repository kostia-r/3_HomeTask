Homework # 3: 
There are three channels in ADC1:
1) reading the voltage of the potentiometer (channel IN3, pin PA3) - visualized by the brightness of the blue LED;
2) reading the temperature from the internal temp. sensor - visualized by the brightness of the orange LED (temperature in °C - duty cycle);
3) reading the temperature from an external temperature. sensor (channel IN9, pin PB1) - visualized by the brightness of the green LED (temperature in °C - duty cycle).
If the value on any of the channels increases above the set critical value - an emergency. If on one channel - the red LED blinks at a frequency of 1 Hz, if on two channels - at a frequency of 2.5 Hz, if on all three - at a frequency of 5 Hz.
